# COMP30027 Project 1

The University of Melbourne
School of Computing and Information Systems
COMP30027 Machine Learning, 2025 Semester 1

Supervised and semi-supervised na√Øve Bayes models to detect scam SMS messages

## Requirements

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Environment Setup

If you are using the full Anaconda distribution, no installation is needed - required packages are already installed.

However, if you're using minimal Python setup, to ensure reproducibility and avoid dependency conflicts, it's **recommended to run this notebook in a virtual environment**.

From the project directory, create venv like so:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Then installed the required packages

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
